## Introduction

-This paper proposed a three-stage modular design for estimating the treatment effect heterogeneity in observational survival analysis.
-The method provides monotonic survival curves with adjustment for selection and censoring bias.
-We automate the identification of features contributing to the effect heterogeneity.
-We avoid the ad-hoc subgroup selection by non-parametrically estimating the conditional treatment effect.
-We provide evidence that oral anticoagulants confer protection against stroke and death on newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients.
